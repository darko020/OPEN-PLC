## PLC
	
PLC stands for Programmable Logic Controller. It is an industrial digital computer made to operate machinery, manufacturing processes, or any other activity that has to be highly reliable, easy to program, and capable of diagnosing process faults.
	
### How it works
	
  - Input Scan: The PLC reads data from input devices/sensors.
  - Program Execution: It executes the program logic step-by-step based on the inputs.
  - Output Scan: It sends the resulting commands to output devices (like motors, valves, etc.).

### PLC programming languages	
 
  - Ladder logic (LD)
  - Function block diagram (FBD)
  - Structured text (ST)
  - Sequential function chart (SFC)
  - Instruction list (IL)
  
### Key Features of PLCs

  - **Rugged and Durable**: Designed to withstand harsh industrial environments, such as extreme temperatures, dust, moisture, and electrical noise.
  - **Easy to programme**: PLCs use specialized programming languages like Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram (FBD), and Structured Text.
  - **Real-Time Operation**: They operate in real-time, meaning the response to an input must be executed in a timely manner.
  - **Modular Design**: PLCs can be expanded by adding additional modules for more inputs and outputs, communication, or other features.
  - **Reliable**: They are designed to operate continuously for long periods without failure.
  
## Open Plc

OpenPLC is an open-source project designed for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which are essential in industrial automation and control systems. OpenPLC aims to provide an affordable and flexible alternative to proprietary PLC systems.[**Open PLC Editor**](/Software/README.md) is open source tool used for programming PLC.
